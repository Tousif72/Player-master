# ExoplayerExample

A simple ExoPlayer2 audio example displaying how to play audio files.

<ol>
<li>Play audio file stored in the filesystem</li>
<li>Play audio file attached as a resource in the res/raw folder</li>
<li>Play audio file from a provided web url</li>
</ol>

## Disclaimer
This example does not target the latest version of either exoplayer or Android SDK. Although it seems to work for most people out of the box, updating it to target the latest versions might break functionality.

## Help wanted
This project would require some fresh work, to update it to the latest versions of Android SDK and ExoPlayer library.
If you have time and skills, please make a PR with the updates and I'll do my best to review it asap.
